title: We're secure

----

Ok, I'll admit it. Getting SSL running across the whole domain took longer than it should have. Now all of our CourseSuite sites (web, payment gateway, forum, helpdesk, apps, etc) are running and communicating securely all the time using the latest web technologies and encryption schemes - all for keeping you and your data safe.

Look for the lock in your browsers location bar!
