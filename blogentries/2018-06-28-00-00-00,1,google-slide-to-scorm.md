title: Convert Google Slides add videos, a quiz and publish html5 course

----

Collaborating on a course and publishing it as SCORM just got quicker! Our Course Assembler web-based app now has the ability to import and convert Google Slides. Work with others on your content and then, when you're ready, publish it to SCORM. 

There are so many uses for the Course Assembler. Word, PDF, PowerPoint, YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, Slideshare, Moodle Book Activity IMS and many, many other formats can be imported and converted. 

The video below is just one example of the Course Assembler in action. In this video we'll show how to convert some Google Slides, create a navigation structure, add some videos and a quiz and then publish it to SCORM - in less than ten minutes.
