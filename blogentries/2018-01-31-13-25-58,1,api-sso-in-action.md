title: New API SSO in Action

----

It's been said before but we thought we should show you how the secure CourseSuite API SSO can look and feel on a live portal. As our Ninja Suite of available apps grows in number the list of available app tiles availableon requesting 3rd party portals will grow dynamically with it.

====

How does it work? a third party portal requests authentication credentials from the CourseSuite site. If the requesting secure token matches a current active subscription then CourseSuite returns the calling portal with an array of data. This then allows 3rd party system to generate the tiles dynamically and with the correct authentication app key associated to each respective CourseSuite App.

Secure single sign on (SSO), White labeled headers in apps and publish to url are all available features of the API integration.
