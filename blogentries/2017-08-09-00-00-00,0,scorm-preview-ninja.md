title: Scorm Previewer

----

We've had the Scorm Debug Ninja up for a while now, but today we've re-released it with a little more functionality as well as an easier to understand interface. No more opening the developer console to look at the SCORM api calls - it's right there on a tab. You can also try out different sizes. It remembers your packages for a couple of days then clears them out automatically (or you can delete them yourself).

Best of all, it's free to use - find it on the [Freebies](https://www.coursesuite.ninja/home/scormninja) tab.
