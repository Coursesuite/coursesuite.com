title: New API access up and running

----

A new API client has selected CourseSuite as their primary content development company. Western Victoria Primary Health Network (PHN) has come on board and is now able to enjoy our new API subscription services and support. 

Utilising our custom API single sign on integration process, they were able to embed our supplied API code into their Learning Management Portal, now allowing multiple content builders to access our cloud based content building apps and services.

*No more staff hunting for that company credit card*

The API system is allowing company management to purchase subscriptions to our software for its employees at a centralised place, providing them with all financial and licensing control.  

More advancements coming in the API areas soon, stay in touch!
