We’ve purposely limited the question types available to ensure the this remains an easy and rapid content development application. It's simple and quick to add a quiz and to use the quiz editor.

Remember, Doc Ninja is not only limited to just SCORM courses - you can export it as a standalone course without tracking and load it onto your website.
