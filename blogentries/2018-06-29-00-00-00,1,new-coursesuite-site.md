title: Coursesuite Site Update

----

**BAM!** Out with the not-so-old and in with the new.  

The Coursesuite site has just had a major redesign from the bottom up at [www.Coursesuite.ninja](https://www.Coursesuite.ninja)

**Why?**


Well, we listened to others - our customers, other professional types and our mate next door. We found a number of improvements to make, from the subscription handling through to the navigation and user interface. 

> *"Our ethos is to enable you effective use of our apps, allowing you to design cool courses Ninja Fast"*

So we’ve changed it. The new design makes it easier to use. It's more informative, provides quick access to all the subscribed apps and allows you to take control of your subscriptions in one easy place.
