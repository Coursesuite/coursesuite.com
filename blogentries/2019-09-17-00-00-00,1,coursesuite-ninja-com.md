title: Rebranding and new domains
----

CourseSuite.Ninja is now coursesuite.com. We've rebranded our sites and pushed them out to their own domains. Last year we began a process of removing the "Ninja" motif from our apps which was felt by the management of the time didn't reflect the spirit of the apps. Since then we have also looked at how we can best assign value to our apps and to our users and found the overhead of of the internal system we had developed for managing the sites and apps was not equitable to the size of our team. We have now broken up the sites into their own domains for ease of development and maintenance, and removed all the cruft that no longer reflects our core values and directions.

Here's where we have landed:

Coursesuite
: [www.coursesuite.com](https://www.coursesuite.com)
