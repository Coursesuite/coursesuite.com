title: Document Ninja - Pro Tier Designs

----

Today we pushed out a new feature to all Document Ninja Pro-Tier subscribers - pre-built designs. When choosing a design for your courses, you can use the existing "basic" designs, or choose one of our ever-expanding list of pre-built designs.

We'll be adding new designs and colour variants over time, so be sure to check back now and then. Your feedback is welcome - just [head on over our contact page](https://www.Coursesuite.ninja/content/contact) and start or join a conversation.

As a bonus you can even edit the code, html and css of our basic designs using the *Advanced* tab to use your own styles or colours as you see fit.
