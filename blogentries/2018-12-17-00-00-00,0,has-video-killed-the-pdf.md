title: Video verse's the PDF

        <h3>Has Video killed the PDF</h3>
            <p>It’s was mentions to us recently at an eLearning conference that Video has killed the pdf in eLearning!</p>
			<p>One of the reasons that PDF's is being considered as a poor modern eLearning delivery method is that there may be better ways to present the same information in interesting dynamic instructional designed method, i.e. Video. </p>
			<p>That being said there are production cost associated with Video's, which modern technologies are also making cheaper and easier to access but it does still factor in this discussion.</p>
		<h3>What’s the problem?</h3>
			<p>This really does come down to the tools that you use to create the content and how engaging it is. There are also some intrinsic completion tracking limitations that both Video and PDF’s have as do other file formats also have.</p>
            <p>For instance can you track how long a student spends in the <a href="https://www.coursesuite.ninja/products/ninja/vidninja" target="cswindow" title="Convert Video to SCORM">Video within your learning managment system</a>? </p>
			<p>Can you force a student to watch 80% of the Video before they move on the next conditionally released navigation item? </p>
			<p>You could say the same for a PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Google docs, Google Slides etc, how do you track if a student actually reads the required content, <a href="https://www.coursesuite.ninja/products/ninja/docninja" target="cswindow" title="Convet PDF to SCORM">how can you track that sort of content</a>?</p>

###Possible Answers
We’ve been able to change the goal post with a couple of our creative Coursesuite apps.

With our Media Ninja, you can still use the same Video, we just allow you to set the completions percentage, allowing you to track your Video's. 

Or you can combine the two if you want and have the PDF converted to HTML5 slides. Then insert your Video, set its completion tracking, set the PDFs completion tracking and export it as a SCORM. 

All of a sudden you have content that is built rapidly, engaging and can track your students' progress.

Just in time learning with Video, PDF, Word, plus 40 other file types just became engaging, mobile ready and easy. 

Using Coursesuite's new <a href="https://www.coursesuite.ninja/products/ninja/docninja" target="cswindow" title="Convet PDF to SCORM">Course Assembler</a> is providing new way ways in allowing Video and PDF's to be considered as modern eLearning content asset types.
