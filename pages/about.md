## what is coursesuite

Coursesuite is a collection of simple web-based tools that let you make SCORM courses. We found that the existing tools for content creation were feature-bloated and expensive and slow - and sought to remedy that. We try to focus our tools on the common problems in elearning - asking *what is the underlying purpose of the content* and *how can we make this easier*. We want content development to be *affordable*.

## our advantage

We believe that tools should be easy to use and focussed on the outcome. Too often do we launch programs or apps then have to wade through layers of menus and options to find the few common features we want to use. Too often we are overwhelmed with design possibilities and choices and settings and switches. All this choice can slow you down from achieving your ultimate goal: *your learners doing the required learning*. We have honed our tools down to just the features that matter and left out the cruft that eats your time and ultimately costs your budget.

## about the team

We're a small team based in northern NSW, Australia. Our staff have been working in elearning for almost 2 decades and have experience in many aspects of online learning including content development, lms development, privacy and security, for K-12 schools through tertiary and corporate training organisations.
